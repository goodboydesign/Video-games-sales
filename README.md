Recommendation: Focus on releasing games for top-performing consoles. Establish partnerships with console manufacturers for exclusive content to boost sales.


Regional Sales Patterns:

Recommendation: Tailor marketing strategies to each region. For example, if a game sells particularly well in Japan, consider localizing more content and increasing advertising efforts in that region.


Critic Scores and Sales Correlation:
